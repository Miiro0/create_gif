# 🖼️ Create GIF with Python

This project demonstrates how to create an animated GIF using Python and the `imageio` library. It combines multiple PNG images into a looping GIF with only a few lines of code.

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `imageio` library (v2.16.2+)

Install the required package:
```bash
pip install imageio
```

## 📁 Files Included

- `create_gif.py` – Main Python script
- `team-pic1.png`, `team-pic2.png` – Images used to generate the GIF
- `team.gif` – Output animated GIF (generated by the script)

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Lists
- For loops
- Reading and writing image files
- Using external libraries with `pip`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place all image files in the same folder as the Python script.
2. In the terminal, run:

```bash
python create_gif.py
```

3. A new file called `team.gif` will be created in the same folder.

## 📸 Output

The generated GIF loops infinitely and displays each image for 500 milliseconds.

## ✨ Bonus Ideas

- Add more images to the list to make longer animations.
- Use your own image files.
- Try adjusting the `duration` or `loop` settings in the script.
